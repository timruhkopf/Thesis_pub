* TEST_UTIL RANDOM test fails.
  Util_bspline.get_design does not necessarily have a rowsum of 1 - for corners
  (it is close fairly though) - perhaps the knots must be placed a little further
  out to ensure this condition.

* TEST_UTIL check_chain_seq does not raise, when first and last entry are same.
